# CS1.0CustomCalc

#This is my custom calculator project for CS 1.0. My calculator first asks the user for their hourly earnings. 
It then displays that on the screen for the user to make sure it is correct. 
I then ask the user how many hours a week they work and also display that on the screen. 
From here I make a variable to store my calculation into and multiply the hourly earnings by the hours they work weekly 
then multiply that value by 52 to figure their annual earnings. Then display that message onto the screen for the user to see.
